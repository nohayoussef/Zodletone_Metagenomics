# Zodletone_Metagenomics
Microbial diversity and sulfur cycling in an early earth analogue: From ancient novelty to modern commonality.

For all other non-sulfur related functional predictions, combined GhostKOALA outputs of all genomes belonging to a certain order (for orders with 5 genomes or less; n=206), or family (for orders with more than 5 genomes; n=85) were checked for the presence of groups of KOs constituting metabolic pathways (additional file 1).
